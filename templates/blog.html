            <div id="blogPreview">
              <p>I remember looking back at my past and realising how confused I‚Äôve been at different stages of life.</p>

              <p>Sometimes when I read my old messages, emails, or random things I wrote back then...</p>

              <p>I feel there‚Äôs such a big difference in how I felt then and how I feel now.</p>

              <p>When I was a kid, I had these wild dreams of saving people, protecting them, sacrificing my life for the people of my kingdom.</p>

              <p>It sounds funny now, but it was real for me back then.</p>

              <p>This dream stayed with me all the way till secondary school.</p>

              <p>After that, I stopped dreaming that big in the same way.</p>

              <p>But that desire to serve people never really left.</p>

              <p>So I thought maybe I should join the army.</p>

              <p>Then I thought, maybe I could become a doctor and save lives.</p>

              <p>But as I grew up, I started understanding more about how the world really works.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Full Blog Content (Hidden by Default) -->
            <div id="blogFull" style="display: none;">
              <p>Around the age of 10 to 12, I got really fascinated with science.</p>

              <p>I admired A.P.J Abdul Kalam and everything he did for India‚Äôs space journey.</p>

              <p>I used to look up at the night sky and wonder what‚Äôs out there.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôd read about space, rockets, satellites ‚Äî anything I could find.</p>

              <p>By 14 or 15, Mission Mangalyaan had just happened and I wished I could become a space scientist.</p>

              <p>So I started doing research on what it would take.</p>

              <p>But even before that, by 13, I had already decided I wanted to be an engineer.</p>

              <p>That became my main goal. And yes, I ended up actually pursuing it.</p>

              <p>But deep down, there was another dream too ‚Äî I wanted to be a lawyer.</p>

              <p>More specifically, a public prosecutor.</p>

              <p>I thought I could fight for justice, help people who can‚Äôt afford a lawyer.</p>

              <p>That dream still lives in me. And I really hope I find a way to make that one happen too.</p>

              <p>After my 10th, I knew I had to take science if I wanted to do engineering.</p>

              <p>And there was one thing I was super clear about ‚Äî I hated Biology with all my heart. üòÇ</p>

              <p>We had to take a career test in school and it said I had the aptitude to be a doctor.</p>

              <p>But I told my teacher straight: ‚ÄúI hate Bio. I‚Äôm dropping it.‚Äù</p>

              <p>And that‚Äôs exactly what I did. I took PCM with Computer Science instead.</p>

              <p>But then came 11th and 12th... And boom ‚Äî confusion again. What do I do next?</p>

              <p>What do I do next?</p>

              <p>I was still thinking about engineering, but I wanted to know more options.</p>

              <p>So I started researching everything possible.</p>

              <p>After months of reading, here‚Äôs what I found:</p>

              <p>In engineering, the top colleges in India are IIT, NIT, BITS.</p>

              <p>Abroad, it‚Äôs the Ivy Leagues ‚Äî like MIT, Harvard, etc.</p>

              <p>I looked into JEE-Mains, JEE-Advanced, BITSAT, SAT, TOEFL, IELTS...</p>

              <p>Then I checked the fees.</p>

              <p>And bro... they were insane. üòÇ</p>

              <p>I checked financial aid options too.</p>

              <p>Some colleges had scholarships, but not much.</p>

              <p>And to get in, I needed something big ‚Äî like international Olympiads.</p>

              <p>That‚Äôs when I thought:<br>
              "If someone told me this earlier, things would‚Äôve been so much easier."</p>

              <p>So I dropped the idea of studying abroad.</p>

              <p>I then focused on JEE-Mains and aimed for NIT.</p>

              <p>Didn‚Äôt get in.</p>

              <p>Looked at BITS, but when I saw that ‚Çπ18 Lakh fee... I was like, ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù</p>

              <p>It was mostly because of the placements.</p>

              <p>My parents said I could take a student loan.</p>

              <p>And I knew even if I got into IIT or NIT, loan was still going to be a thing.</p>

              <p>Now that I think about it ‚Äî thank God I didn‚Äôt get in.</p>

              <p>(I‚Äôll explain why in a later blog. So stick around.)</p>

              <p>Then I looked at CLAT and law again.</p>

              <p>But people said there‚Äôs no good pay or job security unless you get into a top law school or have good connections.</p>

              <p>So I dropped that too.</p>

              <p>Next, I thought of joining NDA and getting into the army.</p>

              <p>But then I found out something that shook me ‚Äî</p>

              <p>If a cadet gets injured during training, NDA doesn‚Äôt take full responsibility.</p>

              <p>And honestly, that made me lose respect for how India treats its soldiers.</p>

              <p>Compared to the US, it felt like we were way behind.</p>

              <p>So that plan also ended there.</p>

              <p>Then I looked into government jobs.</p>

              <p>Checked out SSC-CGL, Bank PO, Railway exams...</p>

              <p>I learned how the jobs are divided by groups, how the pay scale works, what‚Äôs permanent, what‚Äôs transferable...</p>

              <p>And finally, out of all of that, I saw one clear option ‚Äî</p>

              <p>Software engineers were killing it.</p>

              <p>People were getting 25 LPA, 40 LPA, even 1 Cr packages.</p>

              <p>And who doesn‚Äôt want that?</p>

              <p>I was crazy about working at places like Google and Microsoft.</p>

              <p>Since I was decent at coding, I thought I could give it a try.</p>

              <p>And now, with these 4 years of college almost coming to an end...</p>

              <p>I can honestly say ‚Äî a lot changed.</p>

              <p>The tech world changed.</p>

              <p>College life wasn‚Äôt what I expected at all.</p>

              <p>And the real world hit harder than I imagined.</p>

              <p>But I didn‚Äôt let that stop me.</p>

              <p>Because somewhere in the middle of all this confusion,</p>

              <p>I found a bit of clarity.</p>

              <p>A new goal.</p>

              <p>Something that finally feels right.</p>

              <p>Feels like me.</p>

              <p>And now... I‚Äôve slowly started working on it.</p>

              <p>If you‚Äôve ever felt lost or confused like this,</p>

              <p>you can share it in the comments.</p>

              <p>And if you‚Äôre still figuring things out ‚Äî that‚Äôs totally okay.</p>

              <p>You‚Äôre not alone :)</p>
